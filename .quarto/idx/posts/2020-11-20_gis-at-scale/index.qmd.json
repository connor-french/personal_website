Maybe finding the data you need to understand deforestation in Brazil is giving you a headache. Or, you need to run a machine learning algorithm on 50 gigabytes of weather station data and your poor laptop is melting the finish off of your dining room table. <a href=\"https://earthengine.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Earth Engine</a> (GEE) is here to help.\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://earthengine.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the website</a>, GEE's purpose is to:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Provide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale</li>\n\n<li>Enable high-impact, data-driven science</li>\n\n<li>Make substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nGEE is designed to make large-scale GIS projects feasible, but is also suitable for smaller projects. My main use-case is to pull environmental data from their <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">petabyte scale database</a> to model the potential distribution of species through time, e.g. this set of maps projecting the distribution of a species of Peruvian poison dart frog as it's changed since the mid-Pleistocene.\n\n![The first five panels show models of a frog species' potential range from the present-day back to the mid-Pleistocene. The sixth panel shows areas of stability in the frog's range over this time period. These models were constructed using publicly available environmental data related to the frog's ecological tolerances](projections.png)\n\nLarge amounts of data can be pulled down with a single line of code! An \"Earth Engine Snippet\" is provided for each dataset that you can copy into your GEE <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">code editor</a>.\n\n![Example dataset highlighting the type of data available on Google Earth Engine and the ease of acquiring it through the Earth Engine Snippet.](terraclim.png)\n\nIn addition to acquiring data, a myriad of data processing and analytical tools are available. From cropping an image to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">machine learning</a>, these tasks are performed on the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud platform</a>, saving your computer from unnecessary RAM overload. There is a bit of a learning curve to using these tools, especially for those unfamiliar with coding. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">learning resources are plentiful</a>. And for those with a preferred coding language, GEE code has been translated to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript</a> (the native language), <a href=\"https://www.earthdatascience.org/tutorials/intro-google-earth-engine-python-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">python</a>, and <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">R</a>! My preferred language is R, and there are <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a ton of examples</a> to base your own ideas off of. For your next big GIS project, I recommend giving Google Earth Engine a shot!\n\nShould you need help with your GIS project, we have some great resources through the GC Digital Fellows.
