Like a lot a lot. Recent estimates put [the number of insect species](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7519.short) at a whopping 5.5 million. Only about a million have names, leaving the other 4.5 million or so species undescribed. To put this into context, there are [8,053 described amphibian species](https://amphibiaweb.org/amphibian/speciesnums.html) and the projected number of undescribed species remains in the thousands. While I consider all life to be equally important (and I'm particularly fond of amphibians- I mean, just [look at these](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS832US832&biw=1343&bih=650&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=6XpJXc7tOayv_Qac8oGQBA&q=ranitomeya&oq=ranitomeya&gs_l=img.3..35i39l2j0i67l2j0l6.53933.55501..55948...0.0..1.371.943.9j3-1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ujvBzQEfoC8&ved=0ahUKEwiOhpG-p-7jAhWsV98KHRx5AEIQ4dUDCAY&uact=5)), the gap in our understanding of insect diversity is especially concerning. They're important for [agriculture](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/), [flowering plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0qm_L_HPdM), [decomposition](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/insects/ambb/abb_fact.html), and a host of other functions. Without a firm understanding of existing insect diversity, scientists can't accurately determine the causes of [rapid declines](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/why-insect-populations-are-plummeting-and-why-it-matters/) in insect populations across the globe.\n\nNeedless to say, describing 4.5 million species of insect is an onerous task. That's why, as part of my PhD dissertation, I'm devising a new metric of diversity that skirts around this problem. Although I would love to go into excruciating detail about what it is, I'll leave that up to my dissertation chapter. Briefly, I use [DNA sequences](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Fact-Sheet) from insects collected by researchers from [across the globe](http://www.boldsystems.org/) to summarize the [genetic diversity](http://b4fa.org/bioscience-in-brief/plantbreeding/genetic-diversity/) of insect communities, rather than their species diversity. This makes data collection much more feasible across a broad scale. However, exactly what it tells us about insect communities is still uncertain.\n\n![A map of insect DNA sequences deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System.

Machine learning, the part-statistics, part-algorithmic wizardry that helps Snapchat [turn your face into an alien](https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/snapchats-filters-how-computer-vision-recognizes-your-face-9907d6904b91) and Facebook [recommend you](https://research.fb.com/blog/category/machine-learning/) custom underwear, can also be used to answer important scientific questions. In a [biodiversity](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us) context, machine learning can help clarify what about the environment, whether that is climate, topography, human-mediated habitat loss, etc., best predicts a selected metric of diversity. In my project planning stages, I decided to use this approach to assess the relationships my new metric has with other global-scale processes. However, I only had a rudimentary knowledge of the capabilities of a machine learning approach.\n\nThat's why I decided to take the [Applied Machine Learning in R](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/02/06/rstudio-conf-2019-workshops/) two-day workshop in Austin, Texas. The workshop's goal was to \"step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are based on prediction.\" This was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, since it was a part of an industry conference for tech professionals, the [rstudio::conf2019](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), it was prohibitively expensive. Luckily, I was able to secure a [Provost's Digital Innovation Training Grant](https://digitalgrants.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), which covered the costly tuition. As a University of Texas at Austin alumni, I easily found a couch to crash on, which cut expenses significantly. The prime location and generous help from the [GC Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) paved my way to the workshop.\n\nIn between eating [street tacos](http://www.vaquerotaquero.com/) and taking dips at [Barton Springs Pool](https://www.austintexas.org/listings/barton-springs-pool/4687/), I learned the basics of performing machine learning analyses in [R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYUGMg_14s), a programming language centered around statistical analysis. Going in, I had a strong background in R, but I did not have a working knowledge of machine learning. The workshop's [exercises](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) and [strong leadership](https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn) gave me more confidence in using the machine learning techniques I was already familiar with and introduced me to algorithms I had never heard of. It was one of these new algorithms-- I point out it's named [MARS](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/mars.html) for the statistically and astronomically inclined-- that I decided to use for my dissertation chapter. It strikes a balance between predictive power and explanatory ease that I am aiming for in my project.\n\nAfter some months of pulling my hair out, working through the kinks of how to wrangle 4.7 million insect DNA sequences, I was able to use my new machine learning skills to perform preliminary analyses of my data. The results, which I presented as a [poster](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nhvskh6xarg6ej/poster_ConnorFrench.pdf?dl=0) at the [Evolution](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html) conference in Providence, Rhode Island, point toward my metric being a useful summary of insect biodiversity. I received numerous bits of positive feedback that I am currently using to finalize my analyses and publish this work in a professional journal. Initially, I thought this project would take up a large chunk of my PhD, but with the help of the Applied Machine Workshop and GC Digital Initiatives, I was able to jumpstart my analyses and will put out a stronger product, sooner. In due course, I hope my research leads to a stronger understanding of insect diversity and how us humans are impacting it.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"minty","dark":"cyborg"},"title-block-banner":true,"toc-title":"Table of contents","toc-location":"left","page-layout":"article","citation":true,"comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"connor-french/connorfrench"}},"title":"PDIG Training Grant Spotlight: Connor French","author":"Connor French","description":"A review of Applied Machine Learning in R workshop I used the Provost's Digital Innovation Training Grant for.","date":"2019-10-12","aliases":["../pdig-spotlight/"],"categories":["Research","GCDI"],"image":"featured.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
