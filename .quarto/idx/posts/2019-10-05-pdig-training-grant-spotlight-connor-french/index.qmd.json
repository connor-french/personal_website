Like a lot a lot. Recent estimates put [the number of insect species](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7519.short) at a whopping 5.5 million. Only about a million have names, leaving the other 4.5 million or so species undescribed.

They're important for [agriculture](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/), [flowering plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0qm_L_HPdM), [decomposition](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/insects/ambb/abb_fact.html), and a host of other functions. Without a firm understanding of existing insect diversity, scientists can't accurately determine the causes of [rapid declines](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/why-insect-populations-are-plummeting-and-why-it-matters/) in insect populations across the globe.\n\nNeedless to say, describing 4.5 million species of insect is an onerous task. That's why, as part of my PhD dissertation, I'm devising a new metric of diversity that skirts around this problem. Although I would love to go into excruciating detail about what it is, I'll leave that up to my dissertation chapter. Briefly, I use [DNA sequences](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Fact-Sheet) from insects collected by researchers from [across the globe](http://www.boldsystems.org/) to summarize the [genetic diversity](http://b4fa.org/bioscience-in-brief/plantbreeding/genetic-diversity/) of insect communities, rather than their species diversity. This makes data collection much more feasible across a broad scale. However, exactly what it tells us about insect communities is still uncertain.\n\n![A map of insect DNA sequences deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System.

In a [biodiversity](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us) context, machine learning can help clarify what about the environment, whether that is climate, topography, human-mediated habitat loss, etc., best predicts a selected metric of diversity. In my project planning stages, I decided to use this approach to assess the relationships my new metric has with other global-scale processes. However, I only had a rudimentary knowledge of the capabilities of a machine learning approach.\n\nThat's why I decided to take the [Applied Machine Learning in R](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/02/06/rstudio-conf-2019-workshops/) two-day workshop in Austin, Texas. The workshop's goal was to \"step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are based on prediction.\" This was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, since it was a part of an industry conference for tech professionals, the [rstudio::conf2019](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), it was prohibitively expensive. Luckily, I was able to secure a [Provost's Digital Innovation Training Grant](https://digitalgrants.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), which covered the costly tuition. As a University of Texas at Austin alumni, I easily found a couch to crash on, which cut expenses significantly. The prime location and generous help from the [GC Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) paved my way to the workshop.\n\nIn between eating [street tacos](http://www.vaquerotaquero.com/) and taking dips at [Barton Springs Pool](https://www.austintexas.org/listings/barton-springs-pool/4687/), I learned the basics of performing machine learning analyses in [R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYUGMg_14s), a programming language centered around statistical analysis. Going in, I had a strong background in R, but I did not have a working knowledge of machine learning. The workshop's [exercises](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) and [strong leadership](https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn) gave me more confidence in using the machine learning techniques I was already familiar with and introduced me to algorithms I had never heard of. It was one of these new algorithms-- I point out it's named [MARS](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/mars.html) for the statistically and astronomically inclined-- that I decided to use for my dissertation chapter. It strikes a balance between predictive power and explanatory ease that I am aiming for in my project.\n\nAfter some months of pulling my hair out, working through the kinks of how to wrangle 4.7 million insect DNA sequences, I was able to use my new machine learning skills to perform preliminary analyses of my data. The results, which I presented as a [poster](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nhvskh6xarg6ej/poster_ConnorFrench.pdf?dl=0) at the [Evolution](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html) conference in Providence, Rhode Island, point toward my metric being a useful summary of insect biodiversity. I received numerous bits of positive feedback that I am currently using to finalize my analyses and publish this work in a professional journal. Initially, I thought this project would take up a large chunk of my PhD, but with the help of the Applied Machine Workshop and GC Digital Initiatives, I was able to jumpstart my analyses and will put out a stronger product, sooner.
