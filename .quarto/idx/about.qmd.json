I am currently supported as a software engineer, developing the [roleShiny application](https://github.com/role-model/roleShiny) and contributing to the [roleR R package](https://github.com/role-model/roleR). Both of which provide students and researchers access to the [Rules of Life Engine (RoLE) model](https://role-model.github.io/about), which is\n\n> a mechanistic, simulation-based hypothesis-testing and data synthesis framework enabling scientists with multi-dimensional biodiversity data to generate and test parameterized hypotheses about the processes driving biodiversity patterns\n\n## Research focus\n\nMy research focuses on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve across space in response to changing environments. The spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales I work with vary, ranging from single-species landscape genetics to global-scale macrogenetics. In addition to empirical work, I am also wading into the waters of simulation-based testing of spatial population genetic theory and software development to facilitate these types of analyses.\n\n## Previous positions\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018 I completed a M.S. in [Zoology](https://zoology.siu.edu/) at [Southern Illinois University at Carbondale](https://siu.edu/). I worked with [Jason Brown](https://www.jasonleebrown.org/) on the systematics and phylogeography of a genus of poison frogs in Peru and helped develop the second version of [SDMtoolbox](http://www.sdmtoolbox.org/), a python-based ArcGIS toolbox for spatial studies of ecology, evolution and genetics.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015 I completed a B.S. in Biology- [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/) at [University of Texas at Austin.](https://www.utexas.edu/) I completed undergraduate research with [Daniel Bolnick](https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/), [David Cannatella](http://cannatellalab.org/), and the [Texas Biodiversity Collections](https://biodiversity.utexas.edu/collections).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"minty","dark":"cyborg"},"title":""},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
