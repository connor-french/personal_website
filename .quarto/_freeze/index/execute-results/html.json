My ideal role would involve taking advantage of my strong computational and scientific background to solve difficult data problems in science and business. I love each stage of the process- planning, execution, and communication to stakeholders. I am particularly drawn to mission-driven companies that can take advantage of my domain-specific knowledge in genomics, climate, and/or geospatial analytics, but I am open to taking my passion for data science and analytics into unexpected directions. As a data scientist, I particularly enjoy creating reproducible data analytics and machine learning pipelines, creating engaging data visualizations and dashboards, and distilling complex results for a diversity of stakeholder audiences.\n\nMy academic research focuses on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve in response to changing environments. I integrate species distribution modeling using earth observation data with population genomics to address these questions and [develop open-source software](https://github.com/connor-french) to solve these difficult problems.\n\nI'm passionate about [data science](posts.qmd), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/connorfrenchphotography/), music, and my dog Buckley!\n",
