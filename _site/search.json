    "title": "Interactively explore geographic data in R using leaflet",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Originally published on GC Digital Initiatives\n\nWhy leaflet?\nMaking a data visualization interactive opens up a host of opportunities for new insights. This is especially true for geographic data. While a static map is preferable for publication in a journal or a book, an interactive map is suitable for exploring data or packing more information in an accessible format. Patterns may emerge when viewing data at different scales or when toggling through features.\nThere are a number of tools for building interactive maps. Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for creating interactive maps. The leaflet R package is a high-level interface that makes it easy to create beautiful interactive maps in a few lines of code. Using R rather than point-and-click software like ArcMap and others makes your life easier through reproducible code that can be shared for others to recreate your map or that you can return to when you inevitably need to fix something. I use leaflet regularly for data exploration and for sharing preliminary results with collaborators. You can also include leaflet maps in RMarkdown documents, Shiny apps, and even post them to your website!\n\n\nGoal of the tutorial\nThe goal of this tutorial is to provide you with a basic understanding of leaflet functionality and the tools and resources to make your own interactive maps. You will:\n\nRead in geographic data for plotting\nPlot locations of interest using markers\nColor locations according to a factor\nInclude pop-up text that provides metadata about the locations of interest\n\n\n\nInstallation\nYou will need to install four packages for this tutorial. The dplyr package for data manipulation, the sf package for handling spatial data, the rgbif package for acquiring the data, and finally the leaflet package for mapping. All packages are available on CRAN.\n\npackages <- c(\"dplyr\", \"sf\", \"rgbif\", \"leaflet\")\ninstall.packages(packages, dependencies = TRUE)\n\nNow that the packages are installed, you need to load them into your environment.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rgbif)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n\n\nRead in and pre-process data\nThe data you’re going to work with are some locations where rain frogs, genus Breviceps (aka the cute grumpy frog), have been found. Using the rgbif package, you’re querying the large Global Biodiversity Information Repository to obtain the species occurrences. After obtaining the data, some filtering is necessary. First, you’re filtering out observations that do not have latitude or longitude coordinates (hasCoordinate = TRUE) and selecting only the relevant columns for your visualization (select()). Then, you’re converting the data frame that rgbif returns into a simple features (sf) data frame that contains information about which columns to use as coordinates (coords = …) and what the data’s coordinate reference system is (crs = …).\nIf the %>% bit is confusing, don’t worry- I’ll explain in the next section.\n\n\n\nsource: allthatsinteresting.com\n\n\n\nfrog_gbif <- occ_search(\n  genusKey = 3240854,\n  hasCoordinate = TRUE,\n  limit = 100\n  ) %>% \n  .[[\"data\"]] %>%\n  select(\n    genus,\n    species,\n    family, \n    eventDate, \n    decimalLongitude, \n    decimalLatitude\n    ) %>% \n  st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"),\n    crs = \"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\"\n    )\n\n\n\nPlot a basic map\nPlotting a basic map only takes three lines of code! The necessary steps to make a leaflet map are:\n\nInitialize a map widget using the leaflet() function.\nAdd layers using the suite of commands the begin with add*(), e.g. addTiles(), which added the OpenStreetMap tiles and addMarkers(), which added our locality data\nPrint the result. In this case I’m printing the map to the console without assigning it to a variable first.\n\nThe %>% (pipe) operator is used to make code easier to read and help the mapmaking process flow organically. It pipes the output of one function into the input of the next. Intuitively, you can think of the following code as “I initialize the map widget and then add the basemap tiles and then add the locality markers.”\n\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(data = frog_gbif)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is nice and all, but there’s more you can do to make the visualization informative and appealing.\n\n\nCustomization\nNow you’re going to add some pizazz to the map. You’re going to color the labels according to the species and add some popup text with information about the family the individual belongs to, its species name, and the date it was collected. In addition, you’re going to use addCircleMarkers instead of addMarkers to use circles instead of flags. Finally, you’re adding a legend so the colors make sense.\nDetailed explanations of what each function is doing are provided as code comments.\n\n# First, a color palette needs to be set. We're using the viridis palette, but feel free to explore the options available! I set the domain to NULL because I think it's more flexible to have a general color palette that can be attributed to factors later.\npal <- colorFactor(palette = \"viridis\", domain = NULL)\n  \n# This is the text that will go into the popup labels! The popup argument accepts html input, so I'm using \"<br>\" to indicate line breaks. I'd recommend printing this to your console so you can see what the popup argument will be parsing.\npopup_label <- paste(\n  \"Family:\", frog_gbif$family, \"<br>\", \n  \"Species:\", frog_gbif$species, \"<br>\",\n  \"Date Collected:\", frog_gbif$eventDate\n  )\n\n\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  # You're adding circle markers here. In addition, we're specifying the color and popup labels for the markers. The tilde (~) is telling the color argument to accept the output of the pal object, which is now returning colors mapped to each species. Other plotting software like ggplot don't require a tilde to map to factors or numbers, so this may look foreign, but leaflet does and it just takes a little getting used to.\n  addCircleMarkers(data = frog_gbif,\n                   color = ~pal(species),\n                   popup = popup_label) %>%\n  # We're specifying the legend to be in the bottom left of the map. Colors are specified a little differently here. The \"pal\" argument specifies the palette being used and the \"values\" argument specifies the values to map to. We're using the tilde here so it knows that you're mapping to a factor. \n  addLegend(\n    data = frog_gbif,\n    \"bottomleft\", \n    pal = pal,\n    values = ~species,\n    opacity = .9,\n    title = \"Species\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it! This is just the tip of the iceberg with what leaflet can do. You can plot polygons, lines, rasters, icons, and more with only a little more code.\n\n\nGo further\nHere are some more resources to learn more about leaflet and general GIS in R.\nleaflet documentation\nA more involved tutorial that shows off some more leaflet features.\nGeocomputation in R free, online book.

    "text": "Originally published on GC Digital Initiatives\nSometimes your GIS project needs some extra oomph. Maybe finding the data you need to understand deforestation in Brazil is giving you a headache. Or, you need to run a machine learning algorithm on 50 gigabytes of weather station data and your poor laptop is melting the finish off of your dining room table. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is here to help.\nFrom the website, GEE’s purpose is to:\n\n\nProvide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale\n\n\nEnable high-impact, data-driven science\n\n\nMake substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets\n\n\nGEE is designed to make large-scale GIS projects feasible, but is also suitable for smaller projects. My main use-case is to pull environmental data from their petabyte scale database to model the potential distribution of species through time, e.g. this set of maps projecting the distribution of a species of Peruvian poison dart frog as it’s changed since the mid-Pleistocene.\n\n\n\nThe first five panels show models of a frog species’ potential range from the present-day back to the mid-Pleistocene. The sixth panel shows areas of stability in the frog’s range over this time period. These models were constructed using publicly available environmental data related to the frog’s ecological tolerances\n\n\nLarge amounts of data can be pulled down with a single line of code! An “Earth Engine Snippet” is provided for each dataset that you can copy into your GEE code editor.\n\n\n\nExample dataset highlighting the type of data available on Google Earth Engine and the ease of acquiring it through the Earth Engine Snippet.\n\n\nIn addition to acquiring data, a myriad of data processing and analytical tools are available. From cropping an image to machine learning, these tasks are performed on the Google Cloud platform, saving your computer from unnecessary RAM overload. There is a bit of a learning curve to using these tools, especially for those unfamiliar with coding. Thankfully, learning resources are plentiful. And for those with a preferred coding language, GEE code has been translated to JavaScript (the native language), python, and R! My preferred language is R, and there are a ton of examples to base your own ideas off of. For your next big GIS project, I recommend giving Google Earth Engine a shot!\nShould you need help with your GIS project, we have some great resources through the GC Digital Fellows.

    "title": "Sonification for data communication",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Originally published on GC Digital Initiatives\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago my partner shared a TED Talk with me that changed how I conceptualize data communication. In it Dr. Wanda Diaz Merced, an astronomer who lost her eyesight in her early twenties, discusses her journey back into science after this setback. A crucial technique helped her interpret hefty astronomy data sets- sonification. Sonification turns data into sound. It is analogous to data visualization, where both methods aim to communicate patterns and relationships within data clearly and efficiently. Not only did sonification make data accessible for Dr. Merced, it helped her uncover patterns obscured by visualizing graphs and charts.\nThere are quite a few applications for sonification. The bing you get when an email lands in your inbox is one familiar example. The recognizable noise conveys a simple piece of information without requiring you to be sitting at the computer or staring at your phone. Representing large data sets gets a little more complicated.\nAudio has multiple dimensions that can be exploited to represent information, including:\n\npitch\n\nloudness\n\nduration\n\nspatial arrangement (e.g. stereo panning)\n\nThese can be combined to represent multiple data dimensions or used interchangeably to represent the same data in a new way. Best practices are still being formed and are often context-dependent on the user, but a great resource for the latest practices is the Floe Inclusive Learning Design Handbook.\nA particular application that is relevant for folks who want to increase the accessibility of their publications is to sonify their existing data visualizations. Below are a few common examples. Each example is a visualization, followed by the sonification. I have chosen to represent values on the y-axis as changes in pitch, while time indicates change along the x-axis. To emphasize the change in time along the x-axis, I have added short white noise pulses for each data point along the x-axis. The listener is “reading” the plot from left to right.\n\n\n\nA common data visualization technique for single variables is the histogram. These emphasize the distribution of the variable under consideration. Below, I’ve simulated data representing my mood 15 minutes before eating dinner over the last several weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram representing the distribution of mood score values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Notice how the pitch oscillates in a similar manner to the shape of the distribution and the pulses are evenly spaced, representing the bins of the distribution!\n Now, let’s sonify two variables at once! The visualization below is a scatterplot, a common technique for two continuous variables. The data is simulated to represent how much I crave a burger depending on how hungry I am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatterplot representing a linear relationship between two variables. Hunger level on the x axis and burger craving strength on the y axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNotice how the pitch increase with time, but there are oscillations which represent error around a perfect linear relationship. Also notice how the pulses are less even- the points aren’t evenly distributed on the x-axis. Pretty cool!\n\nThe final visualization I’ll present is an exponential relationship between two variables. The simulated data in this scenario represents my craving for a big ol’ plate of nachos dependent on how hungry I am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatterplot representing an exponential relationship between two variables. Hunger level on the x axis and burger craving strength on the y axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn this case, the pitch increases, well, exponentially! In addition, the points are tighter together- The pitch oscillates less than the linearly related data. My nacho cravings are pretty consistent.\n\nThese are just a few ways sonification can be incorporated into your data communication and exploration arsenal. Besides making data more accessible to those who are blind or low vision, sonification opens up another avenue of data exploration to uncover patterns not evident in a visßual medium. Dr. Merced was able to hear a distinct frequency pattern not evident from a chart that led her to discover that star formation likely plays an important part in supernova explosions! Sighted astronomers now use sonfication as a complement to visualization to investigate their data. If you would like to take a crack at sonification yourself, there are a variety of resources. The sonifications for this post were created using the R package sonify, which is a straightforward interface that will get you there quickly, without much overhead. You can find the R code for this blog post here.\n\nThose of us at the Graduate Center Digital Initiatives strive to make interactions with digital media more accessible. We provide a variety of resources to take advantage of digital tools in your research. In addition, we provide community and support with the Digital Fellows, so I encourage you to take a look and connect with us!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{french2021,\n  author = {Connor French},\n  title = {Sonification for Data Communication},\n  date = {2021-04-19},\n  url = {https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2021-04-19-sonification_ttt_post},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nConnor French. 2021. “Sonification for Data Communication.”\nApril 19, 2021. https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2021-04-19-sonification_ttt_post."

    "text": "Originally published on GC Digital Initiatives\nThere are a lot of insects in the world. Like a lot a lot. Recent estimates put the number of insect species at a whopping 5.5 million. Only about a million have names, leaving the other 4.5 million or so species undescribed. To put this into context, there are 8,053 described amphibian species and the projected number of undescribed species remains in the thousands. While I consider all life to be equally important (and I’m particularly fond of amphibians- I mean, just look at these), the gap in our understanding of insect diversity is especially concerning. They’re important for agriculture, flowering plants, decomposition, and a host of other functions. Without a firm understanding of existing insect diversity, scientists can’t accurately determine the causes of rapid declines in insect populations across the globe.\nNeedless to say, describing 4.5 million species of insect is an onerous task. That’s why, as part of my PhD dissertation, I’m devising a new metric of diversity that skirts around this problem. Although I would love to go into excruciating detail about what it is, I’ll leave that up to my dissertation chapter. Briefly, I use DNA sequences from insects collected by researchers from across the globe to summarize the genetic diversity of insect communities, rather than their species diversity. This makes data collection much more feasible across a broad scale. However, exactly what it tells us about insect communities is still uncertain.\n\n\n\nA map of insect DNA sequences deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System. Warmer colors indicate densely sampled areas.\n\n\nTo remedy this, I’m using machine learning. Machine learning, the part-statistics, part-algorithmic wizardry that helps Snapchat turn your face into an alien and Facebook recommend you custom underwear, can also be used to answer important scientific questions. In a biodiversity context, machine learning can help clarify what about the environment, whether that is climate, topography, human-mediated habitat loss, etc., best predicts a selected metric of diversity. In my project planning stages, I decided to use this approach to assess the relationships my new metric has with other global-scale processes. However, I only had a rudimentary knowledge of the capabilities of a machine learning approach.\nThat’s why I decided to take the Applied Machine Learning in R two-day workshop in Austin, Texas. The workshop’s goal was to “step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are based on prediction.” This was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, since it was a part of an industry conference for tech professionals, the rstudio::conf2019, it was prohibitively expensive. Luckily, I was able to secure a Provost’s Digital Innovation Training Grant, which covered the costly tuition. As a University of Texas at Austin alumni, I easily found a couch to crash on, which cut expenses significantly. The prime location and generous help from the GC Digital Initiatives paved my way to the workshop.\nIn between eating street tacos and taking dips at Barton Springs Pool, I learned the basics of performing machine learning analyses in R, a programming language centered around statistical analysis. Going in, I had a strong background in R, but I did not have a working knowledge of machine learning. The workshop’s exercises and strong leadership gave me more confidence in using the machine learning techniques I was already familiar with and introduced me to algorithms I had never heard of. It was one of these new algorithms– I point out it’s named MARS for the statistically and astronomically inclined– that I decided to use for my dissertation chapter. It strikes a balance between predictive power and explanatory ease that I am aiming for in my project.\nAfter some months of pulling my hair out, working through the kinks of how to wrangle 4.7 million insect DNA sequences, I was able to use my new machine learning skills to perform preliminary analyses of my data. The results, which I presented as a poster at the Evolution conference in Providence, Rhode Island, point toward my metric being a useful summary of insect biodiversity. I received numerous bits of positive feedback that I am currently using to finalize my analyses and publish this work in a professional journal. Initially, I thought this project would take up a large chunk of my PhD, but with the help of the Applied Machine Workshop and GC Digital Initiatives, I was able to jumpstart my analyses and will put out a stronger product, sooner. In due course, I hope my research leads to a stronger understanding of insect diversity and how us humans are impacting it.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{french2019,\n  author = {Connor French},\n  title = {PDIG {Training} {Grant} {Spotlight:} {Connor} {French}},\n  date = {2019-10-12},\n  url = {https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2019-10-05-pdig-training-grant-spotlight-connor-french},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nConnor French. 2019. “PDIG Training Grant Spotlight: Connor\nFrench.” October 12, 2019. https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2019-10-05-pdig-training-grant-spotlight-connor-french."

    "text": "Originally published on GC Digital Initiatives\nThe R programming language is a powerful analytical tool that is commonly taught alongside applied fields like statistics, ecology, finance, and more. Efficiently integrating the language into a course can be difficult. For example, the time to set up programming exercises, troubleshoot technical issues, and follow progress can quickly eat away at time you as an instructor would probably like to spend covering course material. This is especially true in the current remote learning environment. The less setup and maintenance, the better.\nLuckily RStudio, the company behind the popular interactive development environment, has a strong, free(!) solution. RStudio Cloud allows teams to manage R projects in a common space. It is a way for team members (students, teachers, etc.) to collaborate, using the same set of software managed from a central location that the administrator, i.e. the teacher, has control over. The “central location” is a remote server hosted by RStudio that removes much of the headache from admin duties (and having to contact IT). This means that you can load all necessary files and packages into a central location and distribute RStudio sessions to each of your students without worrying about differences in operating system, versioning differences, etc. If a student has a problem, you can check on their project and even make fixes from your computer (with some restrictions)!\nThe structure of RStudio Cloud is as follows:\nA project. This is the fundamental unit of work. You store code, packages, and files here.\nThe workspace. This is where you create projects. Only you can access your project, but you can adjust permissions to let them be viewed and copied by other users.\nA private space. This is critical for teaching! You decide who can access this workspace. Inviting and organizing to your private space is simple.\nYou can find a detailed and readable guide here! If you are not quite sure this is for you, below is a typical use case, containing only the essential details.\nYou first set up a private space and determine who can access the space. As an administrator, you can manage membership and can view, edit, and manage all projects in the space. When you add users to the space, their default position is a contributor- they can create, manage, and edit their own projects. If you are fortunate to have a teaching assistant, you can change their permission to moderator, giving them permission to view, manage, and edit all projects in the space. Note- administrators and moderators can edit other users’ projects, but they can only do this when the user has closed the project. Otherwise, you’ll get this error:\n\nYou first create a project within this space and populate it with files, packages, and code that you want students to access. When you are ready to distribute the project, you then change the permissions to allow everyone in the space access and select the option to make this project an assignment. Assignments make it easy for students to obtain their own copy of the project (this includes files, packages, and code), which they do by clicking on the assignments link. They can then edit their own copy, interacting with the R script exactly like they would on their personal computer. All users have the ability to download files to their personal computer if they choose.\nThe working environment for a user looks like a typical RStudio window:\n\nAnd that’s it! There is plenty more detailed discussion of RStudio Cloud’s capabilities and options here.\nThere are a few notable limitations to RStudio Cloud. It is in beta, so there may be some instabilities. Feedback is generally positive, and most recommendations are to save often in case the session crashes, which is rare. The initial member limit for workspaces is 10 members, but all requests for more space are honored (anecdotally, classroom sizes > 100 students are possible). Each project copy is given 1 GB of memory and 1 CPU, so large data possibilities are limited. If your course requires large computational resources and you have these available locally or through a paid cloud service, RStudio Server may be another viable option. Development is happening rapidly, so more features will likely be available soon!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{french2020,\n  author = {Connor French},\n  title = {RStudio {Cloud} for {Education}},\n  date = {2020-05-07},\n  url = {https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2020-05-07-rstudio-cloud-for-education},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nConnor French. 2020. “RStudio Cloud for Education.” May 7,\n2020. https://delightful-alfajores-5cb3d1.netlify.app/posts/2020-05-07-rstudio-cloud-for-education."

As yet, global-scale assessments have largely focused on species richness, phylogenetic diversity, species abundances, and functional trait diversity. Only recently, however, have advances in DNA barcoding and metabarcoding been utilized for global studies of biodiversity. Large-scale georeferenced DNA barcode surveys have great potential beyond their original use as a tool for assessing species diversity. They help identify adaptive potential and ecosystem resilience to disturbance, and more generally catalyze understanding of how intraspecific variation correlates with critical ecological functions.

    "text": "Everything exists in space. Where an organism’s ancestors were influences where it is now and where it is now influences where its decendents will be in the future. Organisms also don’t exist in isolation. Their environment-and the spatial arrangement of their environment-influence where they live, how many there are, and who they mate with. Each organism has a unique lineage that can be traced through time and space. These lineages are encoded in their genomes, which contain stories of organisms and their ancestors. The stories of organisms, populations, and the environments they inhabit enthrall me. I’m interested in describing the patterns, investigating the processes, and telling the stories of populations, encoded in their genomes.\nRelated papers:\nForest cover and geographical distance influence fine-scale genetic structure of leaf-toed geckos in the tropical dry forests of western Mexico (2022)\nFrench, C.M., Berezin, C.T., Overcast, I., De La Cruz, F.R.M., Basu, S., Bernal, R.L.M., Murphy, R.W., Hickerson, M.J., Blair, C.\nBiological Journal of the Linnean Society. 137(4), pp. 686-699.\nPDF Github\nSpeciation with introgression: Phylogeography and systematics of the Ameerega petersi group (Dendrobatidae).

The spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales I work with vary, ranging from single-species landscape genetics to global-scale macrogenetics. In addition to empirical work, I am also wading into the waters of simulation-based testing of spatial population genetic theory and software development to facilitate these types of analyses."
