I am a research scientist who enjoys building pipelines, developing computational tools, and conducting analyses to make science move faster. As a Research Scientist I at [Sarepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com), I work across pre-clinical and clinical domains to connect bench scientists to their data and harness that data to make clearer, quicker decisions. 

I'm passionate about [data science](posts.qmd), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/connorfrenchphotography/), music, and my dog Buckley!
