I am a PhD candidate in the [Mike Hickerson](https://hickerlab.wordpress.com/) and [Ana Carnaval](https://carnavallab.org/) labs at the City University of New York, City College campus.

My research focuses on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve in response to changing environments.

I'm passionate about [data science](posts.qmd), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/connorfrenchphotography/), music, and my dog Buckley!
