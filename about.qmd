## Current position

I recently earned my PhD in Biology- Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior in the [Mike Hickerson](https://hickerlab.wordpress.com/) and (unofficially) [Ana Carnaval](https://carnavallab.org/) labs at City University of New York, City College campus (although my degree is officially from the Graduate Center- confusing). I am currently a Research Scientist at City College, wrapping up publications and software packaging from my PhD work. I'm on the job market!

## Research focus

My research focuses on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve across space in response to changing environments. The spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales I work with vary, ranging from single-species landscape genetics to global-scale macrogenetics. In addition to empirical work, I also wade into the waters of simulation-based [testing of spatial population genetic theory](https://github.com/connor-french/spaceprime) and [software development](https://github.com/connor-french) to facilitate these types of analyses.

## Previous positions

From 2016 to 2018 I completed a M.S. in [Zoology](https://zoology.siu.edu/) at [Southern Illinois University at Carbondale](https://siu.edu/). I worked with [Jason Brown](https://www.jasonleebrown.org/) on the systematics and phylogeography of a genus of poison frogs in Peru and helped develop the second version of [SDMtoolbox](http://www.sdmtoolbox.org/), a python-based ArcGIS toolbox for spatial studies of ecology, evolution and genetics.

From 2011 to 2015 I completed a B.S. in Biology- [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/) at [University of Texas at Austin.](https://www.utexas.edu/) I completed undergraduate research with [Daniel Bolnick](https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/), [David Cannatella](http://cannatellalab.org/), and the [Texas Biodiversity Collections](https://biodiversity.utexas.edu/collections).
