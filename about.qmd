## Current position

I am a research scientist who enjoys building pipelines, developing computational tools, and conducting analyses to make science move faster. As a Research Scientist I at [Sarepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com), I work across pre-clinical and clinical domains to connect bench scientists to their data and harness that data to make clearer, quicker decisions.

## Academic positions

I completed my PhD in Biology at the Graduate Center, City University of New York in June 2024 under the advisement of [Dr. Michael J. Hickerson](https://hickerlab.wordpress.com). My research focused on understanding how populations, species, and communities evolve across space in response to changing environments. The spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales I work with vary, ranging from single-species landscape genetics to global-scale macrogenetics. In addition to empirical work, I also wade into the waters of simulation-based [testing of spatial population genetic theory](https://github.com/connor-french/spaceprime) and [software development](https://github.com/connor-french) to facilitate these types of analyses.

From 2016 to 2018 I completed a M.S. in [Zoology](https://zoology.siu.edu/) at [Southern Illinois University at Carbondale](https://siu.edu/). I worked with [Jason Brown](https://www.jasonleebrown.org/) on the systematics and phylogeography of a genus of poison frogs in Peru and helped develop the second version of [SDMtoolbox](http://www.sdmtoolbox.org/), a python-based ArcGIS toolbox for spatial studies of ecology, evolution and genetics.

From 2011 to 2015 I completed a B.S. in Biology- [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/) at [University of Texas at Austin.](https://www.utexas.edu/) I completed undergraduate research with [Daniel Bolnick](https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/), [David Cannatella](http://cannatellalab.org/), and the [Texas Biodiversity Collections](https://biodiversity.utexas.edu/collections).
